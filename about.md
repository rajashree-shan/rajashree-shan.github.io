    <strong>Hey there!</strong> <br>  
    Glad you are here, <strong>Welcome to my portfolio!!</strong> <br><br>

    I am <strong>Rajashree</strong>, a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for data engineering, data science, and AI/ML. My journey into computer science began with a fascination for computer games, where I was captivated by how lines of code could create interactive and immersive experiences. This curiosity led me to explore deeper into the world of data, and I have since honed my skills in programming, machine learning, and cloud technologies.  
    <br><br>
    
    Always eager to learn, I strive to constantly expand my knowledge and stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. Whether it’s solving complex data problems or developing machine learning models, I am driven by the challenge of turning data into actionable insights.

    Outside of work, I love hiking, exploring new places, and reading books, which keeps me grounded and continuously inspired.
